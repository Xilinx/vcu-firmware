Directory structure
=======
The directory structure is organized as below:
```
|-- top
    | -- release_a (ex, 1.0.0)
    | -- release_b (ex, 1.7.3)
         | == lib
              | == firmware
```

Whenever there's a new release, a new release directory 
is created with directories for available platforms.
